#CONTROLLING DISTANCE
fighter 'a' footwork + boxing intelligence + headmovement + feints + jab = cda
fighter 'b' footwork + boxing intelligence + headmovement + feints + jab = cdb
cda + cdb = cdrt
(cda / cdrt) * 100 = cdra
(cdb / cdrt) * 100 = cdrb

# cdra is fighter 'a' controlling distance % for the round
# cdrb is the fighter 'b' controllig distance % for the round

#The more you control the distance the more you are in range to punch or out of range to not get hit.
#Maximum punches you can throw in a round is 250 punches so if you control the distance 50% of the round you can only maximum of 125 punches per round.
# You need to decide the workrate of the fighter in the round, so if you pick 50% workrate, the fighter would throw 125/2 = 62.5 punches in the round.

#ACCURACY OF PUNCHES thrown is decided by;
fighter 'a' footwork + handspeed + technique + boxing intelligence
against
fighter 'b' headmovement + footwork + defence
# This should give a % of how many thrown punches fighter 'a' actually landed(62.5 thrown)
# If the above stats for accuracy of punches thrown for each fighter was '50' fighter 'a' would have 200, fighter 'b' would have 150.
150/200 = .75
.75 * 100 = 75 (75% punches not landed)
100-75 = 25 (25% of punches landed in round)
0.25 * 62.5 = 15.6 punches landed by fighter 'a'

#THE EFFECT OF THE PUNCHES is decided from;
fighter 'a' handspeed, power, technique and ko power
against 
fighter 'b' chin, defence and body defence
A formula needs to be made for this, where body punches effect dody defence and stamina and head punches chin and defence.

Fighter stamina is also lowered by workrate in previous round + effects of punches landed, but also stamina goes up between rounds depending on original stamina stats.

If a fighter loses 1/4 of chin, body defence or stamina will result in the fighter going down to the canvas.

After all this is actioned, that is the end of the first round and repeats until the end of the fight.]
